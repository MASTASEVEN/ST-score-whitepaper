## 📄 Description

This white paper introduces the concept of **Self-Transparency (ST)** as a foundational shift in human–AI interaction. It proposes a phase-aligned ST-score model that enables large language models (LLMs) to reorganize their response patterns based on user emotional and meta-cognitive states.

The paper outlines:
- The theoretical basis for ST-based interaction
- The formal definition of the ST-score
- Threshold-driven phase transitions in model behavior
- Ethical considerations and existential authority in AI response logic
